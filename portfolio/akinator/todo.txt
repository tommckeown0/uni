Make questions loop over a single list
Use the entire csv file
Ask maximum 20 questions
*Make the nationality question choose a nationality based on available ones

*Set probability of players to 0 when they are eliminated?
I can also use the probability as a threshold and ignore any players below it.
I can use this to loop through the questions again asking contextualised questions.

*Change means to medians - more representative of data values
Add probably/probably not answer options
Change answers to single character and add validation

Make all questions dynamic
 - Make separate question list for repeated questions?
